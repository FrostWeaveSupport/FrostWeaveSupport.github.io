# Raid Rules

The raid rules apply to all members of a Raid party on the server. These rules are applied to all Raids on the server, not only to the Raids in the Endgame Content (ICC, RS, etc.).

## 1. Raid Leader

- The Raid leader is the communication partner for the staff members. If a member of the Raid breaks a rule, the Raid leader will be contacted. If the Raid leader breaks a rule, the Raid can be disbanded. (Depending on the Rule that was broken)

## 2. Raid Members

- Raid members are responsible for their own actions. If a member of the Raid breaks a rule, the Raid leader will be informed and the member will be punished. If a member of the Raid breaks a rule, the Raid will not be disbanded.
(Depending on the Rule that was broken)

## 3. Raid Disbanding

- Depending on the Rule that was broken in a Raid, the staff member are allowed to disband a raid. If the Raid leader breaks a rule, the Raid can be disbanded. If a member of the Raid breaks a rule, the Raid will not be disbanded. If we recognize that members of the same Raid are breaking rules, we will contact the Raid leader. If the Raid leader does not react, the Raid can be disbanded.

## 4. Raid Chat

- The Raid chat is moderated, but only in raids with Random players. This means if you are in a guild group (more than 70% of the Raid members) the Raid chat is not moderated. If this is not the case, the Raid chat is moderated and you have to follow the chat rules. If you break a rule in the Raid chat, you will be punished on report or if a staff member is in the Raid.

## 5. Hackers in Raids

- Hackers in Raids are not allowed as well as on the rest of our Server. If we recognize a hacker in a Raid, we will inform the Raid leader. Depending on the situation, and if multiple members of the Raid are hacking, Raid leader can be punished. In any case, the hacker will be permanently banned.

### 5.1 Guild Raid Hackers

- If we recognize that multiple members of a Guild are hacking in a Raid, we will ban the Hackers and contact the Guild master. Depending on the situation our staff members are allowed to disband the Guild and ban the Guild master.

## 6. Loot Rules changes

- The Raid leader is allowed to set his own loot rules. He has to clearly announce the Raid rules over a Raid warning.
This need to be done before the Raid starts and if you change members during the Raid, you have to announce the rules again. You have to proof that you announced the rules. (Uncropped Screenshot)

## 7. Basic Loot Rules

- If no other loot rules are set, the basic loot rules are applied. The basic loot rules are:<br>
```
MS > OS > Disenchant
```

## 8. Ninja Looting

- Ninja Looting is not allowed. See points 6 and 7 for information about the loot rules. If someone ninja loots, pleaase dont start a discussion in the Raid chat. Open a support ticket by writing a DM to our Discord bot. You have to provide proof that someone ninja looted. (Uncropped Screenshot) If the ninja looting is confirmed, the ninja looter will be punished.
