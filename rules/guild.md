# Guild Rules

The guild rules apply to the Guild master and all members of any Guild on our Server. Please read the Carefully and follow them.

## 1. Guild Names

- Guild names must be appropriate. This includes inappropriate names, impersonating, and advertising.

## 2. Guild Master

- The Guild master is responsible for the Guild and all members of the Guild. If a member of the Guild breaks a rule, the Guild master will be contacted. If the Guild master breaks a rule, the Guild can be disbanded. (Depending on the Rule that was broken)

## 3. Guild Members

- Guild members are responsible for their own actions. If a member of the Guild breaks a rule, the Guild master will be contacted. If the Guild master breaks a rule, the Guild can be disbanded. (Depending on the Rule that was broken)

## 4. Guild Disbanding

- Depending on the Rule that was broken, the Guild can be disbanded. If the Guild master breaks a rule, the Guild can be disbanded. If a member of the Guild breaks a rule, the Guild will not be disbanded. If we recognize that members of the same guild are breaking rules, we will contact the Guild master. If the Guild master does not react, the Guild can be disbanded.

## 5. Guild Chat

- The Guild chat is not moderated. This means that you can use any language in the Guild chat. However, the Guild chat is not a place to break rules. If you break a rule in the Guild chat, you will be punished.

## 6. Hackers in Guilds

- If we recognize that multiple members of a Guild are hacking, we will contact the Guild master. If the Guild master does not react, the Guild will be disbanded.

## 7. Guild Bank

- The Guild bank is not moderated. This means you can setup your permissions however you want. However, if someone steals from the Guild bank, its the Guild masters responsibility to deal with it. We will not refund any items that were stolen from the Guild bank.

## 8. Guild Master Change

- If the Guild master is inactive for more than 30 days, the Guild master can be changed. If you want to change the Guild master, you have to open a support ticket by writing a DM to our Discord bot. You have to provide proof that the Guild master is inactive. (Uncropped Screenshot) If the inactivity is confirmed, the Guild master will be contacted. If the Guild master does not react within 5 Workdays, the Guild master will be changed. If the Guild master reacts within 5 Workdays, the Guild master and the responsible staff member will discuss the situation. If the Guild master is still inactive after 5 Workdays, the Guild master will be changed.

**Thanks for reading our Guild rules.**
