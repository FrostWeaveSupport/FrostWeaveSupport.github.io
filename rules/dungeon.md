# Dungeon Rules


## 1. Dungeon Loot

- Dungeon Loot is not moderated by the staff team. If you are not happy with the loot distribution, you should talk to the group you are running with. If you are unable to resolve the issue, you should find a new group to run with. Keep in mind that the staff team will not get involved in loot disputes. Also remember the chat rules [here](/rules/chat) apply to dungeon group chat as well.

## 2. Dungeon Group behavior

- Every member of the group is expected to do their part. This means that you should be doing your best to contribute to the group. If you are not contributing, you may be kicked from the group. If you do your part and the group is still unable to complete the dungeon, you should not be kicked from the group. If you are kicked from a group for no reason, you should report it to a staff member.

## 3. Dungeon Group Kicking

- If you get kicked from a group, you should report this to our Discord bot. You can do this by contacting him in a private message.
[FrostWeave Helper](https://discord.com/channels/@me/1143844428373561384) is your man for that kind of things. Keep in mind that the staff team will not get involved in loot disputes. Also remember that the staff team needs proof of the kick and also a uncropped screenshot of your game with details or any other kind of a dps/healing meter. (Depending on your class) <br>
If you are unable to provide proof, the staff team will not be able to help you.

## 4. Penalty for unfair kicking

- If you are found to be kicking people from groups for no reason, you will be punished. Its depending on the situation and the staff team will decide what kind of punishement you will get. This can be a warning or a ban until 3 days. If you are found to be kicking people from groups for no reason multiple times, you will be banned for a longer period of time. Bans that are longer than 3 days can only be applied by the server [High Staff](/faq/faq).
